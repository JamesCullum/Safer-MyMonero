            <div class="section-head-terms">4. Description of Services</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms">As described in more detail below, our Services provides in browser software that (a) generates and stores a Monero account address and the associated view private key, and (b) facilitates the submission of Monero transaction requests to the Monero network without requiring you to personally download and install the associated Monero client software.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.1. Account Address and Private Key.</strong> When you create an Account, the Services (software in your browser), generate a pair of cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive Monero via the Monero network. The view key of the account is stored by the Service, which enables it to determine any transactions that are for your account. The private spend key is never stored or known by the Services, which means that it is cryptographically impossible for us to spend funds on your behalf. The combined public keys generated by the Services serve as your Monero account address, and may be shared with the Monero network and with others to complete Monero transactions. The private key uniquely matches the account address and must be used in connection with the account address to create transactions to send Monero from that account address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and your Private Login Key. You acknowledge and agree that anybody that has access to your Private Login Key and/or private key pair will be able to access, spend or transfer the Monero associated with that account address.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.2. No Private Login Key Retrieval.</strong> Our Services do not receive or store your Account's Private Login Key nor the unencrypted private spend key. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account Private Login Key retrieval. Our Services provide you with tools to help you reveal your Private Login Key when logged in, in order to facilitate backups by you, but the Services cannot generate a new Private Login Key for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account Private Login Key. <strong>IF YOU HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF ANY ACCOUNT ADDRESSES AND PRIVATE LOGIN KEY OR PRIVATE VIEW/SPEND KEY PAIRS MAINTAINED IN YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY MONERO YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACCOUNT ADDRESSES WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT PRIVATE LOGIN KEY.</strong></div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.3. Transaction Requests.</strong> All proposed Monero transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Monero public ledger via the Monero distributed consensus network ("Verification Network"), which is not owned, controlled or operated by us. The Services help you submit your Monero transaction request for confirmation to the Verification Network. However, the Monero network, including the Verification Network, is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. We have no control over the Monero network, including the Verification Network, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Verification Network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Verification Network. When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the Verification Network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.4. No Storage or Transmission of Monero.</strong> Monero are an intangible asset, they exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Monero network. The Services do not store, send or receive Monero. Any transfer of title in Monero occurs within the decentralized Monero network and not within the Services.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.5. Relationship.</strong> Company is an independent contractor for all purposes, and is not your agent or trustee.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.6. Accuracy of Information.</strong> You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You acknowledge and agree that Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Monero transaction initiated via the Services. For instance, if you mistype a account address or otherwise provide incorrect information in connection with any transaction request to send Monero via the Service, the Monero will be sent to whatever account address or information you provide. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction request details carefully before completing any transaction requests via the Services.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.7. No Cancellations or Modifications.</strong> Once a transaction request has been submitted to the Monero Verification Network via the Services, the Verification Network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. Company has no control over the Monero Verification Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. As a result, all transaction requests initiated via the Services are irreversible.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.8. Taxes.</strong> It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you complete via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Company is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Monero transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Monero transactions.</div>

        <div>
            <div class="section-head-terms">5. Fees</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>5.1. Company Fees.</strong> Access to the account is free, but the Company may charge fees for additional Services. Specifically, and at a minimum, the Company can and does charge a fee for every transaction that is sent. Any applicable fees will be displayed in each Service.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>5.2. Miners Fees.</strong><br />
            <ol type="a">
            	<li><strong>Overview of Monero Mining.</strong> The Monero Verification Network (described above) is operated by a network of computers that have installed the Monero network software. The individuals who operate those computers, called "miners," voluntarily participate in the Verification Network confirmation process. Monero miners compile a list of pending Monero transactions, called "blocks," verify that each transaction in the block is valid and does not involve an attempt to re-spend Monero, and solve a mathematical algorithm to confirm that the block should be added to the public ledger of confirmed blocks, called the "blockchain." Monero mining is a competitive process. The first miner to verify the transactions in a block and solve the associated algorithms receive (i) an amount of Monero as a reward, which are generated automatically via the Monero network, and (ii) any fees voluntarily included within the block by the individuals who initiated the proposed transactions ("Miners Fees"). Since miners verify Monero transactions on a voluntary basis, it is necessary to include a Miners Fee in order to provide an incentive to the miners to add a proposed transaction to the next block for confirmation via the Verification Network.</li>
            	<li><strong>Miners Fees Options.</strong> At this stage, our Services do not allow you to modify the Miners Fee. It is instead calculated based on the expected minimum fee for that transaction, which in turn is calculated on a per-kilobyte basis dependent on the physical data size of the transaction, which is not necessarily related to the amount of Monero that is being transferred.</li>
            </ol>
            You acknowledge and agree that Company does not receive any Miners Fees in connection with providing the Services, and is not responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified by miners.

If you do not maintain a backup of your Account data outside of the Services, you will be unable to access Monero associated with any account address maintained in your Account in the event that we discontinue the Services.</div>
